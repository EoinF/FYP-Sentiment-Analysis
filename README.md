# FYP-Sentiment-Analysis
My Final Year Project for Integrated Computer Science. 
Written in python. 
Uses Stanford POS tagger and SentiWordNet 3.0

# Dependencies
* NLTK 3.0
* Beautiful Soup 4
* PPR csv files must be placed in folder "../PPR" relative to the repository root
* SentiWordNet 3.0 text file (Although the code could be modified to use the nltk api, which would be preferrable)
* Stanford pos tagger "english-bidirectional-distsim.tagger"
